      <h3>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h3>
      <p>
        I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I
        loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because
        there was too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
        want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
      </p>
      <h2>How I turned things around</h2>
      <p>
        I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I
        literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and
        moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place,
        I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
      </p>
      <h2>Now I live the simple life</h2>
      <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
      <p>With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
